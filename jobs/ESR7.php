	<h2>ESR 7 - Fast dose calculation code development</h2>
	<p>This position is with EDUSAFE partner Canberra in Montigny, France</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for fast dose calculation code
		development</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will provide scientific, programming and application 
		support to the new Canberra dose calculation code development. You will
		strengthen the level of scientific excellence within the R&D Team 
		through strong interactions with the Chief Architects, Product Managers, 
		external researchers (CERN) and customers.</p> 
	<p>Dose and nuclide activities calculations in nuclear characterizations 
		are crucial to routine activities in the various nuclear industries. 
		Current available products do not fulfill the need of the proposed system. 
		You will develop a new dose calculation that performs also the peak 
		efficiency calculations using the ISOCS methodology. A graphical User 
		Interface allowing general geometries and fast modeling is also needed 
		to interface with the calculation engines. These research activities are 
		vital in implementing the radiological aspects of EDUSAFE.</p>
	<p>The studies will be made in close partnership with the LPC
		(Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire), Caen, which will be the
		academic link in France, and CERN, Switzerland.</p>
	<p>This task is part of a larger international collaboration headed by 
		the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN,
		aiming to develop a novel Augmented Reality system for operation in
		hazardous areas. As such, you will also be part of a global system 
		protoype creation and testing campaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment 
		environment.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc/Diploma degree in software
		engineering</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>High level of hands on experience with nuclear instrumentation,
			programming languages and modeling tools mandatory: Windows / Linux
			embedded environment, C++ and JAVA programming.</li>
		<li>Interest in collaborating on projects with customers and potential
			external partners</li>
		<li>Interest in learning new technologies and creativity in applying
			them to customer applications</li>
		<li>Interest in the product development and management process</li>
		<li>Excellent written and oral presentation skills</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of French or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will spend 30% of your contract on secondments with EDUSAFE partners
		at Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, EPFL, in Switzerland 
		for computer vision, camera registration, requirements for AR applications
		and at CERN in Switzerland, for Hubrid silicon pixel detectors technology
		for tracking applications, high energy physics experiments and accelerators
		irradiation and activation profiles, complex scientific infrastructure 
		radiation protection strategy, LHC use case requirements and at the National
		Technical University of Athens, NTUA, in Greece, for activation calculation 
		methods and radiation physics.</p>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities with ESRs from the
		other EDUSAFE partners, workshops, summer schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD at the
		University of Caen, France. The research performed within EDUSAFE will
		contribute towards the PhD at the end of the 3-year appointment.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with Canberra.
		You will be based in Montigny, France. The duration of the contract is 3
		years expecting to start from January 2013, full time.</p>
