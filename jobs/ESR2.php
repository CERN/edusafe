	<h2>3D tracking system development</h2>

	<h3>Fellowship Description</h3>
	<p>The candidate will develop original Computer Vision techniques for
		real-time 3D tracking solutions using a monocular camera. The tracking
		system will then be used for the Augmented Reality applications within
		EDUSAFE. To this end, the candidate will focus on a novel image patch
		recognition method, which will be at the core of the 3D tracking
		system. This will involve building upon recent work on fast image
		patch recognition and scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor search.
		The developments and experiments will be performed first on software,
		and then developed and merged with the WRM system developed by
		University of Roma for speed up.</p>

	<h3>Academic Requirements</h3>
	<p>The candidate must hold a Master's degree in Computer Science, with
		a strong background in mathematics. Experience in Computer Vision are
		welcome but not required. The candidate is required to apply to one of
		EPFL's doctoral schools.</p>

	<p>Candidates will have the possibility to do a PhD at Ecole
		Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).</p>

	<h3>Location</h3>
	<p>This fellowship will be under employment contract with EPFL. The
		candidate will be based in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

	<h3>Secondments</h3>
	<p>Roma2, NOCA, TUM, CAN</p>

	<h3>Duration of fellowship</h3>
	<p>Starting from about January 2013, for a period of 3 years. This post
		is full time and fixed-term.</p>
