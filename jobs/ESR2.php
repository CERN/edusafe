	<h2>ESR2 - 3D tracking system development</h2>
	<p>This position is with EDUSAFE partner Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale
		de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for 3D tracking system
		development</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will develop original Computer Vision techniques for
		real-time 3D tracking solutions using a monocular camera. The tracking
		system will then be used for the Augmented Reality applications within
		EDUSAFE. To this end, you will focus on a novel image patch
		recognition method, which will be at the core of the 3D tracking
		system. This will involve building upon recent work on fast image
		patch recognition and scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor search.
		The developments and experiments will be performed first on software,
		and then developed and merged with the WRM system developed by
		University of Roma for speed up.</p>
	<p>This task is part of a larger international collaboration coordinated 
		by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN, 
		aiming to develop a novel Augmented Reality system for operation in hazardous
		areas. As such, you will also be part of the global system prototype creation
		and testingcampaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment environment.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc/Diploma degree in computer
		science, with a strong background in mathematics</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Experience in Computer Vision is welcome but not required</li>
		<li>Application to one of EPFL's doctoral schools</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of French or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will spend up to 30% of your contract on secondments with
		EDUSAFE partners, including the University of Roma2 "Tor Vergata", in Italy,
		for WRM methodology development, associated chip design, parametric 
		space based algorithm development techniques, and at Novocaptis, in Greece, 
		and at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AUTH, in Greece,
		for video sensing unit development and data transfer for 3D reconstruction
		and pose determination.</p>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities such as common
		activities with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops,
		summer schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>The appointed researcher will be offered the possibility to study 
		for a PhD at EPFL using the research work performed within EDUSAFE 
		project to obtain a PhD at the end of the 3 years contract.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with EPFL. You
		will be based in Lausanne, Switzerland. The duration of the contract
		is 3 years expecting to start from about January 2013, full time.</p>
