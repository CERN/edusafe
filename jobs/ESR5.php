	<h2>ESR 5 - Control System (CS) and Data Aquisition System (DAQ) architecture</h2>

	<p>This position is with the Institute of Accelerating Systems and 
	Applications
		(IASA), Greece</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position with EDUSAFE for Control
		System (CS) and Data Aquisition system (DAQ) architecture</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will be involved in the design and integration of the
		CS and DAQ architecture and components hierarchy so as to meet the
		stringent requirements from the Augmented Reality (AR) technology and
		the software implementation constraints. It needs to be adaptable and
		scalable to various working environment (sea, space, large underground
		areas,..) and must easily accept various types of detectors/sensors.
		Attention needs to be paid to maintain high-speed communication rates
		and data exchange between the supervised persons and supervisors. The
		control system will be developed through web-based methods, the data
		registered to a proper data-base for easy access for off-line
		analysis, the calculated environmental radiation activation maps
		compared and agreed with the radiation data measured on the field. The
		preparation of radiation maps is an essential activity and must be
		solid and well understood.</p>
	<p>This task is part of a larger international collaboration coordinated 
		by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN, 
		aiming to develop a novel Augmented Reality system for operation in 
		hazardous areas. As such, you will also be part of the global system
		prototype creation and testing campaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment 
		enviroment.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc/Diploma degree in Applied Physics
		or Electrical & Computing Engineering</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Good knowledge of Nuclear & Particle Physics and Radiation Physics
			with applications</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge of radiation detectors, front-end
			electronics, test-beam prototype detector measurements.</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge of control and DAQ systems would be an
			advantage.</li>
		<li>Strong interest in a substantial research project, ability to work
			independently, persistence in the face of setbacks and
			self-discipline are important qualities taken into consideration.</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of Greek or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will spend up to 30% of your contract on secondments with EDUSAFE partners
		including Canberra and CAEN University, in France, for dose rates calculations 
		using deterministic and Monte Carlo based software, in-situ characterization 
		using gamma imaging, spectroscopy and dose rates measurements and at CERN, Switzerland,
		for software and DAQ architecture and development for large scale scientific 
		infrastructures, high energy physics experiments and accelerator irradiation
		profiles, activation and radiation characterization.</p>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities such as common test
		campaigns with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops, summer
		schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD in the School
		of Applied Mathematics & Physics Sciences of the NTUA, using the research
		work performed within EDUSAFE project to obtain a PhD at the end of
		the contract.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with the IASA. You 
	will be based in Athens, Greece. The full time contract under EDUSAFE 
	funding is expected to start before the end of 2013 and it will finish on 31 
	August 2016.</p>
