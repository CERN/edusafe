	<h2>ESR 5 - Control System (CS) and DAQ architecture</h2>

	<p>This position is with the National Technical University of Athens
		(NTUA), Greece</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position with EDUSAFE for Control
		System (CS) and DAQ architecture</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will be involved in the design and integration of the
		CS and DAQ architecture and components hierarchy so as to meet the
		stringent requirements from the Augmented Reality (AR) technology and
		the software implementation constraints. It needs to be adaptable and
		scalable to various working environment (sea, space, large underground
		areas,..) and must easily accept various types of detectors/sensors.
		Attention needs to be paid to maintain high-speed communication rates
		and data exchange between the supervised persons and supervisors. The
		control system will be developed through web-based methods, the data
		registered to a proper data-base for easy access for off-line
		analysis, the calculated environmental radiation activation maps
		compared and agree with the radiation data measured on the field. The
		preparation of radiation maps is an essential activity and must be
		solid and well understood.</p>
	<p>You will spend three months on secondment with EDUSAFE partners :
		one month at Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Roma "Tor Vergata" in Italy,
		one month at the Technical University of Munich in Germany and one
		month at CERN, Switzerland.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc/Diploma degree in Applied Physics
		or Electrical & Computing Engineering</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Good knowledge of Nuclear & Particle Physics and Radiation Physics
			with applications</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge of radiation detectors, front-end
			electronics, test-beam prototype detector measurements.</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge of control and DAQ systems would be an
			advantage.</li>
		<li>Strong interest in a substantial research project, ability to work
			independently, persistence in the face of setbacks and
			self-discipline are important qualities taken into consideration.</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of Greek or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities such as common test
		campaigns with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops, summer
		schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD in the School
		of Applied Mathematics & Physics Sciences of the NTUA. The research
		performed within EDUSAFE will contribute towards the PhD at the end of
		the 3-year appointment.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with the NTUA.
		You will be based in Athens, Greece. The duration of the contract is 3
		years, starting February 2013, full time.</p>
