	<h2>ESR 4 - Authoring and visualizer software</h2>
	<p>This position is with ITN partner: CERN, European Organization for
		Nuclear Research, Switzerland</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for the development of the
		system authoring and visualizer software</p>
	<p>As an ESR, your aim is to participate in the architecture design and
		development of the authoring software creating the Virtual Reality
		and Augmented Reality data contents and the visualizer
		software that will display these data on various infrastructure
		displays. The software will be optimized to efficiently integrate the
		required Augmented Reality features in particular the parametric data
		from the 3D tracking system developed by other EDUSAFE partners,
		Novocaptis Greece and EPFL, Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne,
		Switzerland. You will analyse and further develop the Augmented Reality rendering
		methods as well as the transfer of large quantity of video data to the
		various display devices without degrading the system performance. You
		will work in close collaboration with TUM, Technical University of
		Munich, Germany, to develop the user interfaces scalable to various
		types of display devices. You will participate in the system prototype
		creation and testing campaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment
		environment.</p>
	<p>You will spend a fraction of your time on secondments in
		collaborating institutions (EPFL, TUM) (on the following topics:
		computer vision, patch based recognition techniques, 3D reconstruction
		and pose determination, Augmented Reality applications and information 
		visualization, rendering methods)</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: Master/Diploma degree in Electrical and 
		Computer Engineering / Software Engineering / Electronics.</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Knowledge in programming and languages (C++, Java,..)</li>
		<li>Knowledge in web-based application development (HTML, GWT)</li>
		<li>Basic knowledge of electronics</li>
		<li>Knowledge of Augmented Reality technology and methods would be a plus</li>
		<li>Fluent English language is mandatory, Greek language knowledge will be a plus</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The candidate will participate in Network wide activities such as common test
		campaigns with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops, summer
		schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>The appointed researcher will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD 
		at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), using the research work
		performed within the EDUSAFE project to obtain a PhD at the end of the
		3 years appointment. Interested candidates should apply for a PhD position at
		NTUA, by 21 September 2012, according to the announcement 
		<a href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr/index.php?lang=en">here.</a>
		For details please contact Professor 
		<a href="mailto:knikita@ece.ntua.gr">Konstantina Nikita</a></p>
	<p>The ESR will be under employment contract with CERN,
		European Organization for Nuclear Research. The succesful will be based in
		Geneva, Switzerland. The duration of the contract is 3 years starting
		January 2013, full time and fix-term.</p>
