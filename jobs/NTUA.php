	<h2>Control System (CS) and DAQ architecture</h2>

	<h3>Fellowship Description</h3>
	<p>The CS and DAQ architecture and components hierarchy need to be
		designed and integrated to meet the stringent requirements from the
		Augmented Reality (AR) technology and the software implementation
		constraints. It needs to be adaptable and scalable to various working
		environment (sea, space, large underground areas,..) and must easily
		accept various types of detectors/sensors. Attention needs to be paid
		to maintain high-speed communication rates and data exchange between
		the supervised persons and supervisors. The control system will be
		developed through web-based methods, the data registered to a proper
		data-base for easy access for off-line analysis, the calculated
		environmental radiation activation maps compared and agree with the
		radiation data measured on the field. The preparation of radiation
		maps is an essential activity and must be solid and well understood.</p>

	<h3>Academic Requirements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>MSc or equivalent degree in Applied Physics or Electrical &amp;
			Computing Engineering.</li>
		<li>Good knowledge on Nuclear & Particle Physics and Radiation Physics
			with applications.</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge to radiation detectors, front-end
			electronics, test-beam prototype detector measurements</li>
		<li>Experience/knowledge in control and DAQ systems will be
			appreciated.</li>
		<li>Strong interest in a substantial research project, ability to work
			independently, persistence in the face of setbacks and
			self-discipline are important qualities taken into consideration.</li>
		<li>Fluent in English and/or Greek in languages.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Candidate will have the possibility to pursue a PhD in the School
			of Applied Mathematics &amp; Physics Sciences of the National Technical
			University of Athens (NTUA). Location</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Location</h3>
	<p>This fellowship will be under employment Contract with the National
		Technical University of Athens (NTUA). The successful candidate will
		be based in Athens, Greece and visit CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

	<h3>Secondments</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 month at Universita Degli Studi Di Roma Tor Vergata (Feb 2014)
		
		<li>1 month at Technical University of Munich (May 2014)
		
		<li>1 month at CERN (Sep 2013 &amp; Feb 2015)
	
	</ul>

	<h3>Duration of fellowship</h3>
	<p>The duration of the contract will be 36 months - commencing Feb
		2013.</p>
