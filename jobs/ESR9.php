	<h2>ESR 9 - Augmented-Reality-based display and interaction environment</h2>
	<p>This position is with Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen (TUM), Munich,
		Germany</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for Augmented-Reality-based
		display and interaction environment</p>
	<p>As an ESR in computer science and Augmented Reality (AR), you will
		perform research towards developing AR-based display and interaction
		methodologies using, for example, HMDs, tablet PCs and/or stationary
		3D monitors with novel input facilities (multi-touch, motion) to
		support maintenance workers in extreme environments. The system will
		support workers in safety-critical tasks, providing them with
		information in ergonomically and psychophysically acceptable ways from
		computer systems and remote experts - without unduly overstraining or
		distracting them.</p>
	<p>You will participate in eliciting requirements for information
		presentation setups with CERN for 2-3 realistic application scenarios
		and will study a design space of options towards using one (or a
		collection of combined) display(s). You will select a flexible
		architecture to use display subsets for specific user-centered
		evaluations in specific scenarios with focus on specific cognitive,
		physical or technical issues.</p>
<p>This task is part of a larger international collaboration coordinated 
		by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN, 
		aiming to develop a novel Augmented Reality system for operation in 
		hazardous areas. As such, you will also be part of the global system
		prototype creation and testing campaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment 
		enviroment.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc/Diploma degree in Computer Science
		or Computer Engineering</p>
	<p>You should have a good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of
		German or an undertaking to acquire it rapidly.</p>
	<p>You will spend up to 30% of your contract on secondment with EDUSAFE partners
		including Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, EPFL, 
		in Switzerland, on computer Vision, patch based recognition
		techniques, 3D reconstruction and pose determination and at
		CERN, in Switzerland, on LHC use case requirements for the visualizer
		operability and information visualization in case of operational and
		emergency</p>

	<p>You will participate in network wide activities with ESRs from the
		other EDUSAFE partners, workshops, summer schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD at TUM, using he
		research work performed within the EDUSAFE project to obtain a PhD at
		the end of the 3 years contract.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with the
		Fakult&auml;t f&uuml;r Informatik of the TUM. You will be based in Munich,
		Germany. The duration of the contract is 3 years expected to start about 
		January 2013, full time.</p>
