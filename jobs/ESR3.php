	<h2>ESR 3 - Mobile sensing and data transfer platform</h2>

	<p>This position is with EDUSAFE partner NOVOCAPTIS, Thessaloniki,
		Greece</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for mobile sensing and data
		transfer platform</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will work on a research project focusing on the
		ability to monitor personnel and the state of the surrounding
		environment in hostile environments, and more specifically on the
		development of a mobile platform (wearable) that is adaptable to
		different environments with varying sensing and transmitting
		requirements, scalable, robust and cost effective.</p>
	<p>You will design a system architecture, for the wearable system,
		which is modular and flexible enough to accommodate different
		sensing, computational, transmitting and power expenditure
		requirements. A network protocol will be developed to efficiently pass
		sensing information, with special emphasis on video/image
		transmission, in an optimised way. Work will be directed towards
		resolving problems with multiple radio waves arriving in the same
		antenna from different paths. Finally, a systematic methodology will
		be developed to determine the best configuration of component parts to
		be included in the system architecture. The overall vision is to
		develop a robust transmitting device that achieves the necessary
		refresh rates for the various data components.</p>
	<p>This task is part of a larger international collaboration coordinated by 
		the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, at CERN,
		aiming to develop a novel Augmented Reality system for operation in
		hazardous areas. As such, you will also be part of a global system 
		protoype creation and testing campaigns in the LHC ATLAS experiment 
		environment.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc in Electrical/Computer
		Engineering, Computer Science, Communications Engineering, Physics,
		Mathematics or related fields and in their sub-divisions.</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Electronics Design & Fabrication</li>
		<li>Embedded Systems Design & Development (including DSP programming)</li>
		<li>Wireless Networks (including network programming)</li>
		<li>Computational Vision</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of Greek or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will spend up to 30% of your contract on secondments with
		EDUSAFE partners at Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, EPFL, 
		in Switzerland, for computer vision, patch-based recognition techniques, 3D reconstruction
		and pose estimation and at CERN in Switzerland, for augmented
		reality system environment and usability requirements for the
		LHC, large infrastructure wireless architecture design, data
		acquisition architecture and development for large scale
		scientific infrastructures.</p>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities such as common
		activities with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops,
		summer schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD at the
		Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of Electrical and
		Computer Engineering, Greece using the research work performed within 
		EDUSAFE project to obtain the PhD at the end of the 3-year contract.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with NOVOCAPTIS,
		Thessaloniki, Greece. You will be based in Thessaloniki. The duration
		of the contract is 3 years expected to start from about January 2013, full time.</p>
