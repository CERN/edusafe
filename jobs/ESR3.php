	<h2>ESR 3 - Mobile sensing and data transfer platform</h2>

	<p>This position is with EDUSAFE partner NOVOCAPTIS, Thessaloniki,
		Greece</p>
	<p>Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position for mobile sensing and data
		transfer platform</p>
	<p>As an ESR, you will work on a research project focussing on the
		ability to monitor personnel and the state of the surrounding
		environment in hostile environments, and more specifically on the
		development of a mobile platform (wearable) that is adaptable to
		different environments with varying sensing and transmitting
		requirements, scalable, robust and cost effective. This project is
		part of a large collaboration headed by the ATLAS experiment at the
		LHC at CERN and will give researchers experience of dealing with such
		environments.</p>
	<p>You will design a system architecture, for the wearable system,
		which is modular and flexible enough to accommodate different,
		sensing, computational, transmitting and power expenditure
		requirements. A network protocol will be developed to efficiently pass
		sensing information, with special emphasis on video/image
		transmission, in an optimised way. Work will be directed towards
		resolving problems with multiple radio waves arriving in the same
		antenna from different paths. Finally, a systematic methodology will
		be developed to determine the best configuration of component parts to
		be included in the system architecture. The overall vision is to
		develop a robust transmitting device that achieves the necessary
		refresh rates for the various data components.</p>
	<p>You will spend up to 30% of your contract on secondments with
		EDUSAFE partners. : 2 months at EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland, for
		computer vision, patch-based recognition techniques, 3D reconstruction
		and pose estimation; 2 months at CERN, Switzerland, for augmented
		reality (AR) system environment and usability requirements for the
		LHC, large infrastructure wireless architecture design, data
		acquisition (DAQ) architecture and development for large scale
		scientific infrastructures.</p>
	<p>Training will be offered in a number of soft skills including
		project management, financial planning, marketing and others in order
		to develop a well-rounded professional able to work efficiently both
		in academia and industry.</p>
	<p>Preferred university diploma: MSc in Electrical/Computer
		Engineering, Computer Science, Communications Engineering, Physics,
		Mathematics or related fields and in their sub-divisions.</p>
	<p>Requirements:</p>
	<p>Necessary fields contributing to problem solution include, but not
		limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Electronics Design & Fabrication</li>
		<li>System Architecture Development</li>
		<li>Embedded Systems Design & Development (including DSP programming)
		</li>
		<li>Software Systems Design & Development (including Software
			Engineering Development Methodologies)</li>
		<li>Wireless Networks</li>
		<li>Network Programming</li>
		<li>Antenna Design & Communications</li>
		<li>Video encoding / decoding methods (including Signal Processing)</li>
		<li>Computational Vision</li>
		<li>Coding and Information Theory</li>
		<li>Machine Learning and Optimization Theory</li>
		<li>Good knowledge of English; basic knowledge of Greek or an
			undertaking to acquire it rapidly</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You will participate in network wide activities such as common
		activities with ESRs from the other EDUSAFE partners, workshops,
		summer schools and conferences.</p>
	<p>You will be offered the possibility to study for a PhD at the
		Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of Electrical and
		Computer Engineering, Greece. The research performed within EDUSAFE
		will be valid to obtain the PhD Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
		at the end of the 3-year appointment.</p>
	<p>This ESR position will be under employment contract with NOVOCAPTIS,
		Thessaloniki, Greece. You will be based in Thessaloniki. The duration
		of the contract is 3 years starting on 1 January 2013, full time.</p>
