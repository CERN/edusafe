	<p>EDUSAFE ITN offers vast and diverse set of training
		possibilities both in scientific training as well as in complimentary
		skills training.</p>

	<p>The scientific training exposes researchers to a wide range of
		specialized disciplines, such as algorithm design, radiation imaging,
		software, AR/VR state-of-the-art technologies and methods, patterns
		recognition and processing, to mention but a few. The complementary
		skills training concentrates on providing knowledge in areas such as
		project management, entrepreneurship, languages, commercializing
		scientific results and Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

	<p>EDUSAFE is a Marie Curie Initial Training Network and aims at
		career development of young researchers in the field of advanced VR/AR
		Safety Systems for Maintenance in Extreme Environments. The EDUSAFE
		training program offers vast and diverse set of training opportunities
		for the Early Stage Researchers and Experienced Researchers recruited
		in the project.</p>

	<p>Each researcher is assigned an <b>individual research project</b> and
		all of the research projects assigned to an Early Stage Researcher,
		are designed to equal <b>PhD</b> projects. The researchers are also
		encouraged to complete phases of their work in an industrial setting
		as <b>secondments</b> at partner institutions. The EDUSAFE Consortium
		consists of both academic and industrial partners of excellence that
		provide training for the researchers in their areas of expertize.</p>

	<p>The EDUSAFE training program consists of scientific training and
		complementary skills training that take place both in the form of
		courses and lectures at the host institution as well as <b>network wide
		training events</b> arranged within EDUSAFE consortium.</p>

	<p>The <b>scientific training</b> exposes researchers to a wide range of
		specialized disciplines, such as algorithm design, radiation imaging,
		software, AR/VR state-of-the-art technologies and methods, patterns
		recognition and processing, to mention but a few. The technical
		training follows closely the activities in the interconnected research
		WPs. The goal is to provide the researchers with skills to work in an
		interdisciplinary work environment. In order to test their newly
		gained knowledge and their research results, the fellows have access
		to live extreme environment. This will help them understand the
		difficulties and opportunities in transferring research into tangible
		products and solutions.</p>

	<p>The <b>complementary skills training</b> concentrates on providing
		knowledge in areas such as project management, entrepreneurship,
		languages, commercializing scientific results and Intellectual
		Property Rights. These skills are of growing importance in today's
		labor market and in order to ensure a successful career in research,
		the young researchers need to have a great set of soft skills in
		addition to the technical knowledge in their respective fields.</p>
